## Data Description

1. Describe how to access data, where it is stored, who curates it. Make sure to use the original source and curator in addition to the NBER site to which I have linked.

Access: This dataset can be downloaded from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website (www.cdc.gov) as a compressed (e.g., .zip, .dat.Z) file. A derivation of this dataset is also available from the National Bureau of Economic Research website (www.nber.org) in a variety of formats (e.g., Stata, SAS).

Curation: The data is curated in its original source by the CDC through the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. The National Bureau of Economic Research curates the derived datasets. 


2. Cite other key papers that have used this data.

Shih, Tiffany, Desi Peneva, Xiao Xu, Amelia Sutton, Elizabeth Triche, Richard A. Ehrenkranz, Michael Paidas, and Warren Stevens. "The rising burden of preeclampsia in the United States impacts both maternal and child health." American journal of perinatology 33, no. 04 (2016): 329-338.

DeLeire, Thomas, Leonard M. Lopoo, and Kosali I. Simon. "Medicaid expansions and fertility in the United States." Demography 48, no. 2 (2011): 725-747.

3. Describe how the data were collected.

The data were consolidated from a 100% sample taken from birth records in US states. 


4. Include a table that gives descriptive statistics for at least 8 key variables (you can do more).


5. Include at least one key visualization of the data that exhibits an interesting characteristic.

6. Show at least one conditional (slice) description of the data (e.g., all variable descriptive statistics by nationality of survey respondent). This can be a table or visualization.


## Research Paper Critique

Paper: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1440783313495765

1. State the research question of your assigned paper.

2. What data did the paper use?

3. What theory did the paper reference in order to interpret the data? (Note: it is possible that the paper has no reference to theory.)

4. Was your assigned paper a descriptive study, an identification exercise, a numerical solution to system of equations study, or some combination of the three? (These are the three classifications we discussed in class.)

5. What computational methods did this paper use to answer the research question? What was their result or answer to the question?

6. Think of yourself as an academic referee. Give two suggestions to the author(s) of your assigned paper of things the authors might do to improve their results or strengthen their evidence for the answer to the question.
