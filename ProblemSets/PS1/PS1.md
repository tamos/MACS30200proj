## Data Description

1. Describe how to access data, where it is stored, who curates it. Make sure to use the original source and curator in addition to the NBER site to which I have linked.


2. Cite other key papers that have used this data.


3. Describe how the data were collected.


4. Include a table that gives descriptive statistics for at least 8 key variables (you can do more).


5. Include at least one key visualization of the data that exhibits an interesting characteristic.


6. Show at least one conditional (slice) description of the data (e.g., all variable descriptive statistics by nationality of survey respondent). This can be a table or visualization.


## Research Paper Critique

Paper: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1440783313495765

1. State the research question of your assigned paper.

2. What data did the paper use?

3. What theory did the paper reference in order to interpret the data? (Note: it is possible that the paper has no reference to theory.)

4. Was your assigned paper a descriptive study, an identification exercise, a numerical solution to system of equations study, or some combination of the three? (These are the three classifications we discussed in class.)

5. What computational methods did this paper use to answer the research question? What was their result or answer to the question?

6. Think of yourself as an academic referee. Give two suggestions to the author(s) of your assigned paper of things the authors might do to improve their results or strengthen their evidence for the answer to the question.
